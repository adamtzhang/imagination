          4: "The student feels imagination flows easily and passionately. They eagerly take on creative challenges, often set personal goals (like writing a story or designing something), and develop rich, detailed creations.",
          5: "The student experiences imagination as a core strength, generating a constant stream of innovative ideas and investing deep emotion in them. They set lofty creative goals (e.g., writing a book or inventing something) and pursue them fervently, creating complex, fully realized imaginative works."

          3: "Often finds the child immersed in imaginative play or creative projects. The child both imitates and invents, showing excitement and carrying stories or projects further with more detail than before.",
          4: "Sees a child brimming with creativity and enthusiasm. The child invents games, stories, or artwork with little prompting and often becomes immersed in complex imaginative play for extended periods, even applying creativity to solve problems.",
          5: "Observes a uniquely creative child who lives and breathes imagination. The child pours intense passion and focus into self-initiated projects (elaborate stories, inventions, etc.), consistently producing sophisticated, original creations that amaze others."

          3: "Sees solid creative development: the student now produces original work with enthusiasm. This level demonstrates the program’s impact, as the student can tackle and complete moderately complex creative projects.",
          4: "Recognizes a strong return on investment: the student exhibits high creativity and innovation. They initiate and complete creative projects independently with clear purpose and complexity, exemplifying the program’s success in fostering imagination.",
          5: "Sees a flagship outcome: a student with visionary creativity and innovation. This student creates complex, original projects with clear purpose, embodying the transformative impact donors seek and serving as an inspiring example of success."

              4: "The output is rich in personal detail and style. It shows a sophisticated use of memory to create a coherent, personalized narrative, yet it is still fundamentally a recombination of existing ideas.",
              5: "Creative outputs are exceptionally refined. Although they are built entirely on previous experiences, the work is so well executed and intricately combined that it stands as an outstanding example of imaginative recall and recombination, indicating a highly mature level of reproductive imagination."
